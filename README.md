# Knowledge Hub

Knowledge Hub is a Knowledge sharing platform in real-time among university students. This data management system offers an excellent opportunity to develop a knowledgeable community among university students. The problem we have identified is the lack of availability of a committed platform for knowledge sharing among undergraduates of all levels with relevance to a specific course of study and trending tech topics. Moreover, several undergraduates lack guidance and struggle with their courses works. The lack of immediate resources to assist in their needs is a significant problem faced by them. The proposed solution is to develop a web application for collaboration with a massive amount of rich knowledge information among undergraduates(including students from all batches; seniors & juniors) to share resources relevant to each course module and new trending tech topics.
